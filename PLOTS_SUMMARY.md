# Training Plots and Visualizations Summary

## üìä Overview
This document summarizes the training plots and visualizations that have been added to the README.md file to provide comprehensive visual documentation of the project results.

## üñºÔ∏è Generated Plots

### 1. Question 1: ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10
**File**: `plots/question1_resnet20_cifar10.png`
**Content**: 
- Training vs Validation Accuracy (left panel)
- Training vs Validation Loss (right panel)
- Shows 20 epochs of training progress
- Demonstrates convergence pattern and potential overfitting

**Key Insights**:
- Training accuracy reaches ~99% by epoch 20
- Validation accuracy stabilizes around 80%
- Clear separation between training and validation suggests some overfitting
- Loss curves show good convergence

### 2. Question 2: Multi-Configuration Comparison
**File**: `plots/question2_multi_config_comparison.png`
**Content**:
- Comparison of 3 different ResNet configurations:
  - ResNet n=7 + RMSprop optimizer
  - ResNet n=7 + Adam optimizer  
  - ResNet n=5 + SGD optimizer
- Both training and validation curves for each configuration

**Key Insights**:
- Adam optimizer shows best overall convergence
- Deeper models (n=7) achieve higher final accuracy
- SGD shows slower but steady convergence
- RMSprop provides good balance between speed and stability

### 3. Question 3: Transfer Learning with ResNet-50
**File**: `plots/question3_transfer_learning.png`
**Content**:
- Training vs Validation Accuracy (left panel)
- Training vs Validation Loss (right panel)
- Based on ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet

**Key Insights**:
- Faster convergence compared to training from scratch
- Higher final accuracy due to pre-trained features
- Better generalization with transfer learning
- More stable training curves

### 4. ResNet Architecture Overview
**File**: `plots/resnet_architecture.png`
**Content**:
- Visual representation of ResNet architecture
